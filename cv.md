Profile
-------

My passion is invested in the development and continued innovation of the web. Since leaving University
a little over a year ago, I have had the opportunity to work in a small web development agency – spending
significant time developing and releasing applications in OO-PHP (using MVC frameworks such as
CodeIgniter and Laravel), Python and Java. Through this employment, I have been able to apply many
concepts I learnt during my University course – along with handling real-world use-cases in the form of
working with large startups and local businesses.

In one such startup I was tasked with both the development and accompanying load-distributed CentOS,
MySQL server’s setup. This included a web application written in CodeIgniter (inc. Database migrations,
Composer for dependency management), internal maintenance/data crawlers written in Python/Bash and
a mobile application written in JavaScript (Titanium SDK). The mobile application has since been
successfully released into the iTunes and Android stores. All aspects took advantage of the Git version
control system and unit tested in the case of the web application with PHPUnit.

I enjoy the practical application of software design and development, however I still feel the need and
find significant enjoyment in continuing to learn in this ever-changing field. As a result of this I spend
many hours outside of work completing online University courses (Coursera), listening to podcasts,
blogging about my latest technical interests and collaborating with peers on GitHub. This can also be
seen by my decision to continue my studies this coming September to complete a Masters in Computer
Science, having been accepted into both the University of Southampton and Kent.

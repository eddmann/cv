Profile
-------

Since leaving University I have had the opportunity to work for both a small web development agency and complete Freelance assignments.
During this time I have developed and released applications in OO-PHP (i.e. CodeIgniter and Laravel), Python and Java.
Through these experiences, I have been able to apply many concepts I learnt during my University course - along with handling real-world use-cases in the form of large startups and local businesses.

In one such startup I was tasked with both the development and accompanying load-distribution of a three server LAMP setup.
This included a web application written in CodeIgniter, internal maintenance/data crawlers written in Python/Shell and a mobile application written in JavaScript (Titanium SDK).
The mobile application has since been successfully released into the iTunes and Android stores.

A large Freelance project I also undertook was to begin implementing the fundamental feature-set for a Resource Management System written in Laravel and Sphinx.
This has since been successfully passed over to another developer, thanks to strong use of Git, Composer, Vagrant and PHPUnit (for meaningful testing).

I enjoy the practical application of software design and development, however I still feel the need and find significant enjoyment in continuing to learn in this ever-changing field.
As a result of this I spend many hours outside of work completing online University courses (Coursera), blogging about my latest technical interests and share a weekly podcast with a group of like-minded developers.

I am ideally looking for a job where I can work with many different types of specialist, each who bring their own expertise to solve a common goal.
I would also like the ability to continue my exploration of new technologies, allowing me to further my own education and the product I am involved in at that time.
